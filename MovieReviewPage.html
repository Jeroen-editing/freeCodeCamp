        <p>The movie is bad, so read the book from Stephen King. It's always better to read the original book.
            Even if Stephen King writes a scenario of one of his books himself.
            After all, Stephen King isn't realy a good writer, so films of his books are even worse.
            But as mostly in life, there are some exceptions. And his Dark Tower series is quiet good.
            Hearts in Atlantis is a small part of that series, a sidestory in it.
            And it is a rather good book. <br>I just wished they didn't make a mowie about it.
            And certainly not with Anthony Hopkins in the main role üòâ.
