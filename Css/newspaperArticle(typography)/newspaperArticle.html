                For the first time in Australian history, a state has entered into a formal treaty with its 
                Indigenous people. In Victoria, where Melbourne is located, Aboriginal people will now have 
                a say in policies that affect their lives. The state government calls it a historic step toward 
                reconciliation and recognition of the injustices inflicted on Indigenous people for centuries.

                After two days of debate, the Upper House of the Victorian Parliament passed the Treaty Bill 
                by 21 votes to 16.

                    "This treaty gives the Aboriginal community the power to shape the policies that affect 
                    their lives," says State Premier Jacinta Allan. "This is how we build a fairer and stronger 
                    Victoria for everyone."

                The local agreement comes two years after the national referendum on an Indigenous voice in 
                the constitution failed. That referendum was about a constitutional amendment to recognize 
                Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as Australia's original inhabitants. Nearly 60 
                percent of the Australian population opposed the proposal at the time.

                Ngarra Murray, co-chair of the First Peoples' Assembly, therefore calls the treaty "a historic

                children, and pass on to future generations the story of how decades of Aboriginal resilience 
                and activism led to Australia's first treaty."

                Indigenous people continued to campaign for greater recognition of their initiatives.

                <summary>Inequality in Australia:</summary>
                <p class="text">
                    The gap between Indigenous people and the rest of Australia is deep and has grown 
                    historically. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up approximately 
                    3.8 percent of the population, but fare worse than other Australians in almost 
                    every way. They live an average of nine years less, commit suicide twice as often, 
                    and are significantly overrepresented in prisons.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    This inequality has its roots in Australia's violent colonial past. When the country 
                    was incorporated as a penal colony by the British Crown in 1788, the Indigenous 
                    population was expelled, poisoned, and murdered. The "White Australia" policy, which 
                    systematically removed Indigenous children from their parents, persisted until the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    For decades, the atrocities and traumas of colonization were ignored or concealed. 
                    That history still leaves deep scars: many Aboriginal people still struggle with 
                    marginalization, poverty, and racism. The new treaty should help finally close that gap.

            <h3>What exactly does the treaty entail?</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Part of the treaty is the continuation of the work of the Yoorrook Commission, which has 
                been engaged in fact-finding in recent years. This commission, whose name refers to the 
                word "truth" in the Wemba Wemba language, states, among other things, that during the 
                colonization of Victoria, over three-quarters of the Indigenous population was killed 
                in the 20 years. The commission therefore concludes irrefutably that genocide was 
                committed against the Indigenous population.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In addition, the treaty establishes a new democratic body. This body, to be called the 
                Gellung Warl Commission, will henceforth be consulted on laws and policies affecting 
                Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In this way, the commission will ensure that the government meets its obligations to 
                close the gap between Indigenous and white Australians.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                One concrete consequence of the treaty agreement is a revision of the school curriculum. 
                The updated curriculum should offer children insight into the dark chapters of Indigenous 
                Australian history. The Victorian state government will also formally apologize to the 
                country's Indigenous people.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                What remains unclear, however, is the price tag for implementing the treaty. It's 
                estimated that the new initiatives will likely cost tens of millions of dollars annually.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The local opposition is already strongly opposed to the agreement and has promised to 
                immediately scrap the proposal if it comes to power. The new state elections at the end 
                of 2026 could therefore once again sweep the reforms aside.

                The reconciliation process appears to be making significant progress. A growing 
                number of states are actively pursuing similar initiatives. For example, a commission 
                has been established in South Australia to represent the voice of the local Indigenous 
                population.
