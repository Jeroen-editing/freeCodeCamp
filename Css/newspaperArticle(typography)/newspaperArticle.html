                For the first time in Australian history, a state has entered into a formal treaty with its Indigenous people. In Victoria, 
                where Melbourne is located, Aboriginal people will now have a say in policies that affect their lives. The state government 
                calls it a historic step toward reconciliation and recognition of the injustices inflicted on Indigenous people for centuries.

                    "This treaty gives the Aboriginal community the power to shape the policies that affect their lives," says State Premier

                The local agreement comes two years after the national referendum on an Indigenous voice in the constitution failed. That 
                referendum was about a constitutional amendment to recognize Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as Australia's 
                original inhabitants. Nearly 60 percent of the Australian population opposed the proposal at the time.

                "We will tell our children about this day, and they will tell their children, and pass on to future generations the story

                 Indigenous people continued to campaign for greater 
                recognition of their initiatives. It took over 10 years to finally implement the treaty in Victoria.

                celebrated. It is an opportunity for all Victorians to acknowledge our shared history, heal, and move forward together," Murray said.

                <summary>Inequality in Australia:</summary>
                <p>
                    The gap between Indigenous people and the rest of Australia is deep and has grown historically. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
                    people make up approximately 3.8 percent of the population, but fare worse than other Australians in almost every way. They live an 
                    average of nine years less, commit suicide twice as often, and are significantly overrepresented in prisons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This inequality has its roots in Australia's violent colonial past. When the country was incorporated as a penal colony by the 
                    British Crown in 1788, the Indigenous population was expelled, poisoned, and murdered. The "White Australia" policy, which 
                    systematically removed Indigenous children from their parents, persisted until the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For decades, the atrocities and traumas of colonization were ignored or concealed. That history still leaves deep scars: many 
                    Aboriginal people still struggle with marginalization, poverty, and racism. The new treaty should help finally close that gap.
                </p>
